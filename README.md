An attempt to complete "HTML/CSS from the begining" course by Brad.

Inline CSS vs Internal CSS vs External Styling

- Inline  : styling along with the actual html body added as an attribute to each tag
- Internal: styling inside the head element inside <style> </style>
- External: adding an external .css file using the <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
